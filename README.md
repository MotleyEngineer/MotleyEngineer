### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Who am I? I'm currently a DevOps tech lead for a developer-focused innovation centre within my company. By nature I'm an engineer (and individual) with diverse interests, thus MotleyEngineer.

By day, I currently work on building out cloud-based managed services, automation, and tooling. 

In the past, I've been an Android developer, fullstack developer, and cloud platform engineer.

I enjoy working on end to end projects, from initial ideation to deployment into production and maintenance.
